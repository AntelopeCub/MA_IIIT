# Visualization of the Loss Function of Neural Networks
This is the repo of Yanglin Xu's master thesis.
## Usage of the repo
Training of CNNs and plotting loss surfaces of the loss functions.
## Description of files
`main.py` realize the main function of the repo, which can both train a network and plot loss surface.  
`train_script.py` is used to train a specified network with different conditions.  
`main_script.py` is a further implement of `main.py`  
Other files are modules of the repo.
